# Loan Prediction using ML Algorithms

In today's fast-paced financial landscape, loan prediction plays a pivotal role in assessing creditworthiness and mitigating risk for lending institutions. The ability to accurately predict whether a loan applicant will default or repay their loan is crucial for ensuring sustainable lending practices and maximizing profitability. With the advancements in technology and the ever-increasing availability of data, machine learning (ML) models have emerged as powerful tools for loan prediction, offering improved accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional statistical approaches.

This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of various ML models for loan prediction, with the ultimate goal of selecting the most suitable model for production deployment. By examining different ML algorithms and evaluating their performance metrics, this study aims to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions when implementing loan prediction systems.

_We will start with the Exploratory Data Analysis_
_Then we'll look into Data Cleaning (if necessary)_
_Finally we'll try our various ML models and try to fit our data accordingly_
_Choose the Best Model for the production_

**The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable loan prediction model using machine learning techniques. The project seeks to identify the optimal set of hyperparameters that will yield the highest accuracy in predicting loan outcomes.**
